# Diabetes-Prediction
About the Dataset
The Diabetes prediction dataset contains medical and demographic information of patients, including their diabetes status, age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The dataset can be utilized to develop machine learning models for predicting diabetes in patients based on their medical and demographic features. This can be helpful for healthcare professionals to identify patients at risk of developing diabetes and to create individualized treatment plans. Furthermore, researchers can use the dataset to examine the associations between different medical and demographic factors and the possibility of developing diabetes.
